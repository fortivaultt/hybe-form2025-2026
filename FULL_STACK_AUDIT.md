# Full Stack Security Audit Report - August 25, 2025

## 1. Executive Summary

This report details the findings of a full-stack security audit conducted on the HYBE Fan-Permit application. The audit covered dependency vulnerabilities, backend code, frontend code, and configuration files.

The application has a robust and well-designed Email OTP system, which incorporates many security best practices as outlined in previous internal audits. The backend code for this system is secure, using strong hashing, salting, rate limiting, and brute force protection. The frontend code is also well-protected against common vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

However, the audit identified several critical and high-severity vulnerabilities related to the application's configuration and missing implementations of planned security features. The most significant issues are the lack of security headers for static assets and the absence of database encryption. These findings lower the overall security posture of the application and should be addressed before production deployment.

**Overall Security Rating:** ðŸŸ¡ **REQUIRES HARDENING** (Secure for Staging, but not for Production)

## 2. Detailed Findings

### ðŸŸ¥ Critical Vulnerabilities

**1. Missing Security Headers for Static Assets**

- **Description:** The `netlify.toml` configuration file fails to apply critical security headers (such as `Content-Security-Policy`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Frame-Options`, etc.) to the main application site (`index.html`) and other static assets. While the serverless functions apply these headers to their own responses, the main site served to users is unprotected.
- **Impact:** This significantly increases the risk of various attacks, including XSS, clickjacking, and protocol downgrade attacks.
- **Recommendation:** Add a comprehensive set of security headers to the `netlify.toml` file to apply to all `/*` paths. This should include a strict Content Security Policy (CSP).

### ðŸŸ§ High Vulnerabilities

**1. Unimplemented Database Encryption**

- **Description:** The codebase includes logic and configuration (`DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY`) for database encryption, but the feature is not implemented. The SQLite database file is stored in plaintext on the filesystem.
- **Impact:** If an attacker gains file-level access to the server, they can access the entire OTP database, including hashed OTPs, salts, email addresses, and user metadata. While the OTPs are hashed, this exposure still represents a significant information disclosure risk.
- **Recommendation:** Implement database-at-rest encryption using the `DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY`. The `sqlcipher` package is a common choice for encrypting SQLite databases.

### ðŸŸ¨ Medium Vulnerabilities

**1. Unused Content Security Policy (CSP)**

- **Description:** `lib/security.js` contains a function to generate a Content Security Policy, but it is never used. This is related to the critical finding about missing security headers.
- **Impact:** The application is missing a key defense-in-depth measure against XSS and data injection attacks.
- **Recommendation:** Implement the CSP generated by `generateCSPHeader` in the `netlify.toml` configuration. The policy itself may need to be refined to match the application's specific needs.

**2. In-Memory Brute Force Protection**

- **Description:** The brute force protection for OTP verification (`verify-otp.js`) is implemented using in-memory maps. In a serverless environment, this means the protection state (lockouts, attempt counts) is lost every time the function instance has a cold start.
- **Impact:** A determined attacker could bypass the rate limiting and brute force protection by initiating requests that are handled by different function instances or by waiting for instances to recycle.
- **Recommendation:** As noted in the code comments, this data should be moved to a centralized, persistent store like Redis or a dedicated database table for production environments.

**3. Inconsistent Security Header Application in Functions**

- **Description:** The `verify-otp.js` function hardcodes its own security headers, which are less comprehensive than those generated by the `getSecurityHeaders` utility in `lib/security.js`.
- **Impact:** This leads to configuration drift and a weaker security posture for that specific function endpoint.
- **Recommendation:** Refactor `verify-otp.js` to use the centralized `getSecurityHeaders` function.

### ðŸŸ¦ Low Vulnerabilities

**1. Frontend Dependency Vulnerabilities**

- **Description:** The `npm audit` of the frontend `package.json` revealed 7 low-severity vulnerabilities in development dependencies (`serve`, `netlify-cli`).
- **Impact:** These vulnerabilities are unlikely to affect the production application but represent poor security hygiene.
- **Recommendation:** Run `npm audit fix --force` to remediate these issues, or update the dependencies manually.

**2. Lack of Input Sanitization in Form Handlers**

- **Description:** The `submit-form.js` and `submit-fan-permit.js` Netlify functions do not perform any validation or sanitization on the data they receive before logging or forwarding it.
- **Impact:** While the primary risk of unsanitized data is on the backend, logging unsanitized data could lead to log injection or other issues if the logs are consumed by other systems.
- **Recommendation:** Apply basic sanitization to all incoming data in these functions before processing.

**3. Codebase Confusion (Unused Code)**

- **Description:** The repository contains an unused `functions` directory and an unused React application in the `src` directory.
- **Impact:** This can cause confusion for new developers and increase the maintenance burden.
- **Recommendation:** Remove the unused directories and files to clean up the codebase.

## 3. Conclusion and Recommendations

The application has a strong security foundation, particularly in the OTP system. The development team has clearly paid attention to the recommendations from previous audits. To prepare the application for a production environment, the following actions are recommended in order of priority:

1.  **Implement Comprehensive Security Headers:** This is the most critical issue. Update `netlify.toml` immediately.
2.  **Implement Database Encryption:** Protect the sensitive user data at rest.
3.  **Centralize Brute Force Protection:** Move the in-memory brute force counters to a persistent store like Redis.
4.  **Refactor and Clean Up:** Address the inconsistent header application and remove unused code to improve maintainability.
5.  **Update Dependencies:** Remediate the low-severity vulnerabilities in the frontend dependencies.
