## 🔒 Security Features Implemented

### 1. **OTP Generation & Storage**

- Cryptographically secure random generation using `crypto.randomInt()`
- PBKDF2 hashing with SHA-512 and 32-byte random salts
- No plaintext storage of OTP codes
- 5-minute expiration with automatic cleanup

### 2. **Rate Limiting & Abuse Prevention**

- **Email-based**: 3 OTP requests per 5 minutes
- **IP-based**: 10 verification attempts per 15 minutes
- **Progressive Lockouts**: 30-minute IP bans after exceeding limits
- **Cooldown Periods**: 1-minute delays between requests

### 3. **Input Validation & Security**

- RFC 5322 compliant email validation
- Temporary email domain blocking
- XSS and injection attack prevention
- Content Security Policy headers
- Comprehensive input sanitization

### 4. **Monitoring & Logging**

- Security event logging with severity levels
- Failed attempt tracking with IP/email hashing
- Performance monitoring and audit trails
- Privacy-preserving logging (no sensitive data)

## 🔄 End-to-End User Flow

1. **Form Filling**: User fills out subscription form
2. **Email Entry**: User enters email address
3. **Verification Trigger**: Click "Verify" button triggers OTP request
4. **OTP Generation**: System generates secure 6-digit code
5. **Email Delivery**: Branded email sent with OTP code
6. **Code Entry**: User enters OTP in modal dialog
7. **Verification**: System validates OTP against stored hash
8. **Success**: Email verified, form submission enabled
9. **Submission**: Form can now be submitted with verification token

## ⚡ Performance & Reliability

### Database Performance

- Indexed queries for O(1) lookup performance
- Automatic maintenance and cleanup
- Concurrent access handling
- Memory-efficient operations

### Email Delivery

- Multiple provider fallbacks
- Retry mechanisms for failed deliveries
- Development mode with console logging
- Template caching for performance

### Frontend Responsiveness

- Non-blocking verification process
