# Configuration Audit Summary

This audit reviews the project's configuration files (`netlify.toml`, `server.js`, `vite.config.js`) to identify potential conflicts or misconfigurations.

## 1. `netlify.toml`

- **Build Command:** `npm run build`
- **Publish Directory:** `dist`
- **Redirects:**
  1.  `/api/countries` -> `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all?fields=name,cca2` (Status 200)
      - **Purpose:** Proxies requests to the Restcountries API to avoid CORS issues on the client side. Used for populating the country dropdown.
  2.  `/api/ipinfo` -> `https://ipwho.is/` (Status 200)
      - **Purpose:** Proxies requests to the IPWhois API for auto-detecting the user's country.
  3.  `/*` -> `/index.html` (Status 200)
      - **Purpose:** Standard Single Page Application (SPA) fallback rule to ensure all routes are handled by the frontend router.

## 2. `server.js` (Express Server)

- **Static Files:** Serves static files from the `dist` directory if it exists, otherwise from the project root.
- **Endpoints:**
  1.  `POST /submit-form`: A simple form submission endpoint. **Note:** This endpoint is not used by the main form, which submits to Formspree. It may be a remnant or for testing purposes.
  2.  `GET /*`: A catch-all route that serves `index.html`, similar to the Netlify SPA rule.
- **CORS:** Configured to allow origins from `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable or `localhost`.
- **Security:** Implements basic security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.).

## 3. `vite.config.js`

- **Configuration:** Standard Vite setup. No server proxies or complex configurations were found that would conflict with the other settings.

## Conclusion

- **No Direct Conflicts:** The `netlify.toml` and `server.js` configurations do not have conflicting routes. The `/api/*` routes are handled by Netlify proxies, and the `/submit-form` route is only defined in the Express server.
- **Dual Deployment Strategy:** The presence of both files indicates two potential deployment targets:
  1.  **Netlify:** A static deployment where the frontend is served from the `dist` folder, and API calls are proxied via Netlify functions/redirects. This aligns with the `netlify.toml` file.
  2.  **Node.js Server:** A stateful deployment where the Express server handles file serving and API requests. This is used for local development, as seen in the `npm run dev` script.
- **Recommendation:** The configurations are sound for their respective environments. The key takeaway is understanding which environment is active. For a Netlify deployment, `server.js` is not used. For local development, `netlify.toml` is not used.
