# CORS Configuration Review

This report assesses the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration in `server.js`.

## 1. Configuration Analysis

The Express server uses the `cors` middleware package. The configuration is as follows:

```javascript
app.use(
  cors({
    origin: process.env.ALLOWED_ORIGINS?.split(",") || [
      "http://localhost:3000",
      "http://localhost:5173",
    ],
    credentials: true,
  }),
);
```

### Key Points:

1.  **Dynamic Origin Control:** The `origin` property is dynamically configured using the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable. This is a security best practice, as it allows administrators to specify a whitelist of allowed domains in production without hardcoding them into the source code.

2.  **Development Fallback:** If the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable is not set, the configuration provides a default array `['http://localhost:3000', 'http://localhost:5173']`. This is a sensible and secure default for local development, allowing the frontend (served by Vite on port 5173) to communicate with the backend server (on port 3000).

3.  **Credentials Support:** The `credentials: true` option is enabled, which allows the server to accept requests that include credentials (like cookies or authorization headers). While not strictly necessary for the current functionality, it is a common requirement for authenticated applications and does not introduce a vulnerability on its own.

## 2. Security Assessment

- **Rating:** âœ… **PASS**
- **Analysis:** The CORS configuration is implemented securely and correctly.
  - It avoids the insecure practice of using a wildcard (`*`) for the origin in a production environment.
  - It properly isolates development and production configurations through the use of an environment variable.
  - There are no apparent vulnerabilities in the CORS setup.

## 3. Conclusion

The CORS configuration is robust, secure, and follows established best practices for both development and production environments. No changes are recommended.
