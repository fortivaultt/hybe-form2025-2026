# Database Security Check

This report assesses the project's database usage and its exposure to common database-related vulnerabilities like SQL injection.

## 1. Database Dependencies

The `package.json` file lists the following database-related dependencies:

- `sqlite3`
- `pg` (PostgreSQL)

## 2. Code Analysis

A thorough review of the active application code (`server.js`, `script.js`, and files in `lib/`) shows that **neither `sqlite3` nor `pg` are imported or used**.

The application's data persistence and authentication are handled entirely by external, third-party services:

1.  **Formspree:** The main subscription form data is sent directly to a Formspree endpoint. Formspree is responsible for processing and storing this data securely.
2.  **Supabase:** User authentication, including email and OTP management, is handled through the Supabase client library. Supabase manages its own secure database backend.

## 3. SQL Injection Risk Assessment

- **Risk Level:** **Negligible**
- **Reasoning:** The application does not construct or execute any raw SQL queries. All database interactions are abstracted away by the SDKs of the external services (Supabase) or sent to a managed service (Formspree). By not writing its own database interaction code, the application avoids the primary risk vectors for SQL injection vulnerabilities.

## 4. Conclusion

The project has **no direct database interaction** in its current implementation. The presence of `sqlite3` and `pg` in `package.json` appears to be a remnant from a previous or alternative version of the application and does not reflect the current architecture.

**Security Assessment:** âœ… **PASS**. The risk of SQL injection is negligible as this responsibility is offloaded to trusted third-party services. No vulnerabilities were found in this area.
