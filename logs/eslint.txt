ESLint run output:
(node:930) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file://eslint.config.js?mtime=1759329943911 is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to package.json.
