Routing & Serverless Config Audit

- netlify.toml:
  - [[redirects]] /api/countries and /api/ipinfo proxy to external APIs with force=true.
  - [[redirects]] /* -> /index.html 200 (no force flag).
- Vite build inputs include success.html.

Risk:
- The catch-all 200 rewrite can shadow /success.html on Netlify depending on precedence. Add an explicit rule before the wildcard:
  [[redirects]]
    from = "/success"
    to = "/success.html"
    status = 200

- No serverless functions directory found.
