# Success Page Redirect Validation

This report validates the application's logic for redirecting to a success page after a successful form submission.

## 1. Code Analysis (`script.js`)

The primary form submission logic is handled by the `submitFormInternal` function in `script.js`. After receiving a successful (2xx) response from the Formspree endpoint, the following code is executed:

```javascript
modalManager.show("digitalCurrencySuccessModal", {
  countdown: {
    duration: 5,
    elementId: "digital-currency-countdown",
    onComplete: () => {
      window.location.href = "success.html";
    },
  },
});
```

This code does two things:

1.  It displays a success modal (`id="digitalCurrencySuccessModal"`).
2.  It starts a 5-second countdown. Upon completion, it programmatically redirects the user to `success.html` by setting `window.location.href`.

Additionally, the modal contains a button (`id="digital-currency-home-btn"`) that allows the user to redirect immediately. Its event listener also points to the same location:

```javascript
document
  .getElementById("digital-currency-home-btn")
  .addEventListener("click", () => {
    window.location.href = "success.html";
  });
```

## 2. File Existence

The target file, `success.html`, exists in the root of the repository.

## 3. Conclusion

- **Rating:** âœ… **PASS**
- **Analysis:** The application correctly implements the redirect to `success.html` upon successful form submission. The logic is sound and provides a clear path for the user after their submission is complete. No issues were found in this part of the flow.
