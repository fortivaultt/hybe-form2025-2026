# HYBE Form → Email → Verification → Success Flow Audit

Executive summary: The form uses a client-only flow with Supabase Auth for email OTP and posts submissions to Formspree. The local Express server serves static assets and a non-used /submit-form endpoint. The primary blockers are missing configuration for the Formspree endpoint and a potential Netlify rewrite conflict for the success page. Several low-severity content/dependency cleanups are suggested. No SQL or server DB writes were found; OTP verification is handled by Supabase SDK.

## Environment & Snapshot
- Package manager: npm (no lockfile detected)
- Node/npm: v22.16.0 / 10.9.2
- Dev server: proxy 5173, command `npm run dev`
- Snapshot/log: logs/workspace-snapshot.txt

## Static Analysis
- ESLint: no errors (see logs/eslint.txt)
- Prettier: formatting issues in E2E_TESTING_GUIDE.md (logs/prettier.txt)
- TypeScript: not configured (logs/tsc.txt)

## Flow Mapping
- Frontend submit: script.js → fetch(import.meta.env.VITE_FORMSPREE_URL, FormData)
- Email OTP: lib/supabaseClient.js → supabase.auth.signInWithOtp / verifyOtp(type="signup")
- Local API: server.js → POST /submit-form (sanitizes/validates; not used by form)
- Routing: success.html included in Vite build; Netlify catch-all rewrite present

## Provider Verification
- Supabase: uses built-in OTP email; no custom SMTP. Cannot verify without VITE_SUPABASE_* in runtime.
- SMTP/SendGrid/Mailgun: no code paths detected.

## Runtime Tests
- cURL POST /submit-form → 200 OK (logs/simulated-form-submission.txt)
- Could not trigger actual OTP email in this environment.

## Security & DB
- No SQL queries present; Supabase SDK only.
- CORS: Express allows localhost origins; secure headers applied.
- npm audit: 0 vulnerabilities (logs/npm-audit.json)
- Secret handling: requires VITE_SUPABASE_URL/ANON_KEY for client. Do not expose service role to client.

## Top Findings
1) High – VITE_FORMSPREE_URL not configured → submissions fail.
2) Medium – Netlify rewrite may shadow /success.html (add explicit /success → /success.html).
3) Low – Success page contact email mismatch; fix mailto and visible text.
