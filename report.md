# HYBE Fan-Permit Form: Maintenance and Bug Scan Report

- **Date:** 2025-09-30
- **Analyst:** Jules
- **Branch:** `detached from 34b6537`

## 1. Executive Summary

The repository contains a frontend-heavy application for a detailed fan subscription form. The core user flow involves filling out the form, verifying an email address via a One-Time Password (OTP), and submitting the data to an external service (Formspree). The email OTP functionality is handled by Supabase.

The scan revealed **one high-severity issue** that is likely preventing the email verification from working correctly, thereby blocking the entire user flow. The issue is a misconfiguration in the Supabase API call for OTP verification. Several low-severity issues were also identified, including a dependency vulnerability, code formatting inconsistencies, and unused code/dependencies that should be cleaned up.

The application is otherwise well-structured, follows security best practices for secret management, and has a non-blocking UI. The following report details all findings and provides recommended fixes.

## 2. Top 3 Issues

1.  **(High) Incorrect Supabase OTP Verification Type:** The email verification call uses the wrong `type`, causing the flow to fail.
2.  **(Low) Unused Database Dependencies:** The project includes `sqlite3` and `pg` as dependencies, but they are not used, adding unnecessary bloat and a potential attack surface.
3.  **(Low) Code Formatting and Linting Issues:** The codebase has numerous formatting inconsistencies and unused variables that impact maintainability.

This section details all identified issues, their severity, and suggested fixes.

| ID            | Severity | Title                                    | Location(s)                | Description                                                                                                                                                                              | Suggested Fix                                                                                                       |
| :------------ | :------- | :--------------------------------------- | :------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **SUPA-001**  | **High** | Incorrect Supabase OTP Verification Type | `lib/supabaseClient.js:41` | The `verifyEmailOtp` function uses `type: 'email'`, which is incorrect for verifying an OTP sent via `signInWithOtp`. The correct type is `'magiclink'`. This blocks the main user flow. | Change `type: 'email'` to `type: 'magiclink'`. See `julie-suggested-fixes/SUPA-001.diff`.                           |
| **NPM-001**   | **Low**  | Low-Severity Vulnerability in `vite`     | `package.json`             | `npm audit` reported a low-severity vulnerability in the `vite` package. While the risk is low, it's best practice to keep dependencies updated.                                         | Run `npm audit fix` to automatically update the vulnerable dependency.                                              |
| **STYLE-001** | **Low**  | Code Formatting Inconsistencies          | Multiple (25 files)        | The Prettier check found 25 files with formatting issues. Consistent code style improves readability and maintainability.                                                                | Run `npx prettier --write .` to fix all formatting issues.                                                          |
| **LINT-001**  | **Low**  | ESLint Unused Variable Warnings          | `script.js`, `server.js`   | ESLint found 11 instances of unused variables. These should be removed to improve code quality.                                                                                          | Review and remove the unused variables flagged by ESLint. The full list is available in `logs/static-analysis.log`. |
| **DEPS-001**  | **Low**  | Unused Database Dependencies             | `package.json`             | The project includes `sqlite3` and `pg` as dependencies, but they are not used. These should be removed to reduce the project's dependency footprint.                                    | Run `npm uninstall sqlite3 pg` to remove the unused packages.                                                       |
